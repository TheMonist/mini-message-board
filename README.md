# mini-message-board

This is a basic message board for the Odin Project. The goal of this project is
to implement a basic Model View Controller (MVC) pattern that is found in most
modern backends today.

It is using the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- NodeJS (JavaScript Backend)
- Express (NodeJS Framework)
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating for rendering html/views files)
